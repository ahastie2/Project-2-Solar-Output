Electricity generation from solar farms continues to play a larger and larger role in United States energy systems. This is also true at the University of Illinois where they have been generating electricity from 20 acre solar farm since 2012 with plans to develop a second solar farm by the end of 2020 (cite here). Given the University's diverse energy supply portfolio, its is important to reliable predict generation from these diverse sources in order to balance supply with the predictible demands from University facilities. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning mode that will predict solar electricity generation from weather forecasts.
